# Block Permutation Tool
## Description:
Block permutation is a useful tool to encrypt the image by permutate the image blocks using a pseudo-random key. This code is for the people who studies in Rerversible Data Hiding in Encrypted Image (RDHEI).

* Image size: 512x512 grayscale image
* Block size: 2x2
* Sender: Shffule all the blocks to encrypt the image by the encryption key
* Receiver: Refuule all the blocks to decrypt the encrpyed image to the original image.

There are 65536 blocks in the image, this code shffule all the 2x2 block using a encryption key then gereante an encrypted image, then the receiver is able to use the same permutation key to reshuffle the block (decryption) to recover the image.

## Usage 

* Change the image path to the image that you want to encrypt.
* Run the code.
* Get the encrypted or decrypted image.
